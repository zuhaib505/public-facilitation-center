## About Public Facilitation Services
The website is used to facilitate users so they can find all types of workers at the same point. There is no need to bother for any type of skillful person.
In this app, there are two types of users first is the service provider and the second is the service gainer. The service gainer (customer) can book an appointment with the service provider and will be served accordingly. The app will be simple to use and effective enough to facilitate users.

### Scope And Purpose Of The Website
This project will provide a single platform for multiple service providers to facilitate users. The scope of our project is to design a complete environment to provide a safe and user-friendly environment for online service booking. The main aim of the project is to provide an easy-to-use application for services provided for customers.
We often get frustrated while taking the appointment of service provider because many problems occur like the service provider might be busy or somewhere else or he is not receiving our call or his cost is very high according to the problem. So, in this project, we will remove this headache.
